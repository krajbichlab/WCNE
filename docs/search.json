The symposium brings together decision scientists from across the West Coast and beyond, including leading researchers, graduate students, and practitioners interested in understanding the neural, psychological, and computational mechanisms underlying economic decision-making.\n\nMission\nOur mission is to:\n\nFoster Collaboration: Create opportunities for researchers across institutions to connect and collaborate\nShare Knowledge: Provide a platform for presenting and discussing the latest findings in neuroeconomics\nTrain Future Researchers: Support graduate students and early-career researchers in developing their work\nBridge Disciplines: Promote interdisciplinary dialogue between neuroscience, economics, psychology, and related fields\n\n\n\nWhat is Neuroeconomics?\nNeuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that combines methods from neuroscience, economics, and psychology to study how the brain makes decisions. The field examines:\n\nHow neural systems represent value and process rewards\nThe computational mechanisms underlying choice behavior\nHow social context influences decision-making\nThe role of emotions and cognitive processes in economic choices\nApplications to understanding real-world decision-making in markets, policy, and everyday life\n\n\n\nAcademic Focus Areas\nTopics covered at the symposium include:\n\n\nCore Topics - Value-based decision making - Reward processing and learning - Risk and uncertainty - Temporal discounting - Social decision making - Strategic thinking and game theory\n\n\nMethods and Applications - fMRI and neuroimaging techniques - Computational modeling - Behavioral experiments - Eye-tracking and psychophysiology - Applications to policy and health - Consumer neuroscience"

    "text": "Keynote Speaker\n\nProf. Christian Ruff, PhD\nProfessor of Neuroeconomics and Decision Neuroscience University of Zurich, Department of Economics Director, Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research\nProf. Ruff is a leading figure in neuroeconomics whose research focuses on human motivation, decision-making, and learning. His work develops models to explain and predict choices and social behavior across diverse contexts, using a multi-methods approach that combines behavioral experiments and computational modeling with neuroimaging and brain stimulation.\nAfter studying psychology, cognitive science, and neurobiology in Freiburg (Germany) and Vancouver (Canada), Prof. Ruff obtained his PhD in cognitive neuroscience at University College London in 2007. He founded the Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research (SNS Lab) in 2007 and has been at the University of Zurich since 2010.\nResearch Interests: - Neural mechanisms of decision-making and social behavior - Computational modeling of choice and learning - Value-based decision processes - Brain stimulation and neuroimaging methods\nFaculty Profile | Google Scholar\n\n\nAdditional Speakers\nWe are currently confirming additional invited speakers for West Coast Neuroecon 2025. Speaker announcements will be made in the coming weeks. Stay tuned for updates!"
