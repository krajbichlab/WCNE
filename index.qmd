## Welcome

The West Coast Neuroeconomics Mini-Symposium brings together decision scientists from across the West Coast and beyond. This annual event provides a platform for sharing cutting-edge research, fostering collaborations, and advancing our understanding of the mechanisms underlying decision-making.

We expect an engaging and collaborative atmosphere with plenty of opportunities for discussion and connection. We hope to attract participants from throughout Los Angeles including Caltech, USC, and UCLA, as well as researchers from across the West Coast.

## About the Symposium

The West Coast Neuroeconomics Mini-Symposium is an annual gathering dedicated to advancing the field of neuroeconomics through the presentation and discussion of cutting-edge research. The symposium brings together decision scientists from across the West Coast and beyond, including leading researchers, graduate students, and practitioners interested in understanding the neural, psychological, and computational mechanisms underlying decision-making.

### What is Neuroeconomics?

Neuroeconomics is an interdisciplinary field that combines methods from neuroscience, economics, and psychology to study how the brain makes decisions. The field examines things like:

- How neural systems represent value and process rewards
- The computational mechanisms underlying choice behavior
- How social context influences decision-making
- The role of emotions and cognitive processes in economic choices
- Applications to understanding real-world decision-making in markets, policy, and everyday life

### Prof. Christian Ruff, PhD

**Professor of Neuroeconomics and Decision Neuroscience**
**University of Zurich, Department of Economics**
**Director, Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research**

Prof. Ruff is a leading figure in neuroeconomics whose research focuses on human motivation, decision-making, and learning. His work develops models to explain and predict choices and social behavior across diverse contexts, using a multi-methods approach that combines behavioral experiments and computational modeling with neuroimaging and brain stimulation.

After studying psychology, cognitive science, and neurobiology in Freiburg (Germany) and Vancouver (Canada), Prof. Ruff obtained his PhD in cognitive neuroscience at University College London in 2007. He founded the Laboratory for Social and Neural Systems Research (SNS Lab) in 2007 and has been at the University of Zurich since 2010.

**Research Interests:**
- Neural mechanisms of decision-making and social behavior
- Computational modeling of choice and learning
- Value-based decision processes
- Brain stimulation and neuroimaging methods

## History

The West Coast Neuroeconomics symposium has been bringing together the decision science community for 3 years. Previous symposiums have been hosted at UC San Diego's Rady School of Management, featuring presentations from leading researchers and fostering important collaborations that have advanced the field.

This year, we are excited to host the symposium at UCLA's Meyer & Renee Luskin Conference Center, continuing our tradition of excellence and expanding our reach within the research community.
