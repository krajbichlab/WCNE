### Ian Krajbich

**University of California, Los Angeles**

Ian Krajbich is a leading researcher in neuroeconomics. His lab uses behavioral experiments, computational modeling, and neuroimaging techniques to study how the brain makes decisions of preference, from simple binary (e.g. do I want to eat an apple or an orange?) to complex multi-attribute (e.g. what apartment should I rent?) choices.

### Kianté Fernandez

**University of California, Los Angeles**

Kianté Fernandez's studies how intelligent systems represent, evaluate, and decide under limited computational resources, integrating approaches from mathematical psychology, neuroscience, and computational psychiatry. His work spans species and methods to uncover how attention, memory, and evaluation processes operate and sometimes fail.
